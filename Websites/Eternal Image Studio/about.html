                Lynzi is a graduate from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and entereing the field of medicine. She has been involved in art for over 10 years, which all started with the video game Kingdom Hearts 2. She searched images of the game because she loved it so much, found that most of the fan art was in an anime style. She patterned her style after that and today her fan art has unique anime/realistic style. Her portrait work is exceptionally detailed and precise, through her technique of using stricly graphite pencils. This provides her art with a softer, lighter tone. Lynzi also experiments with watercolor techiques in her personal art. Watercolor commissions may be accepted if she is willing. Due to her current schedule, Lynzi can oly accept a limited number of commissions per month.
