                    David Price is the wealthiest man on the Red Sox.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a team that is full to bursting with stars, many of them high-priced, David Price's contract is worth twice as much as anyone's. He's been the <em>richest</em> player on the team for some time now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But today he is the wealthiest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To understand his plight, you must understand the Boston sports media, and how unreservedly vitriolic they are toward their own players. While Sox fans worldwide will ride this championship wave straight through spring training and well further, the implausibly loathsome media personalities within the city have long since fallen back into arguing about how, because our two MVP candidates only hit a pair of home runs between them over the course of a five-game World Series, they are choke artists, and we are on thin ice with them moving forward if our intent is to build a dynasty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    David Price has given them months' worth of content. A $217-million-dollar 33-year-old on a seven-year deal who repeatedly gets his ass spanked by the Yankees and damaged his elbow inexplicably ... well, you can only imagine how <em>Felger & Mazz</em> and "The Curly-Haired Bastard" Dan O'Shaughnessy might react.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Price lived it. A great teammate by every account and an elite starting pitcher for more than a decade, he's endured unceasing amounts of shit from the press and their army of bleacher scum. Though he posted the best earned run average in the American League during the second half of the 2018 season … we'd long since locked up the division by then. What have you done for me <em>lately</em>, David Price? Can you beat the <em>Yankees?</em> When are you gonna <em>come through?</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    He posted the following stat lines in order during the 2018 playoffs:

                    That's three dominant wins against the second- and third-best teams in baseball, one clinching a World Series berth, another clinching a World Series, with a scoreless ninth-inning relief effort for good measure.
