                Steve Pearce grew up in my <em>backyard</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I <em>watched</em> him when he was a young slugger for the Wiliamsport Crosscutters. I was in attendance on the last day of the season when he won Crosscutters' Most Valuable Player.

                Thirteen years later, that very same<br class="mb-br"> (squatter, grayer)<br class="dt-br"> Steve Pearce is <strong>World Series Most Valuable Player</strong><span class="period">.</span> And I was watching, again, in much greater amazement.

                36-year-old Steve Pearce has lived my wildest dream &mdash; for he has the distinct privilege of being a devout Red Sox fan himself, born and raised. I could never have known, in 2005, that he and I shared the same fantastical daydreams of blasting monster dingers in the clinching finale of a Red Sox World Series Championship. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I6WRw8W9Uo" class="external-vid" target="_blank"><span></span></a>
